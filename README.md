[Jacob Kaplan's Concatenated Files: Uniform Crime Reporting Program Data: Offenses Known and Clearances by Arrest, 1960-2018](https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/project/100707/version/V13/view)

# Data Notes
This data is coming from the FBI Uniform Crime Report. For our analysis, we will be considering data from law enforcement agencies who both included all 12 months' worth of UCR data, as well as agencies who included partial 1-11 months of data. We can see that between 2017 and 2022, there have been a different number of law enforcement agencies submitting to UCR per year. Specifically, in 2017, 197 agencies submitted UCR data, in 2018, 197 agencies submitted UCR data, in 2019, 188 agencies submitted UCR data, in 2020, 187 agencies submitted UCR data, in 2021, 136 agencies submitted UCR data, and in 2021, 151 agencies submitted UCR data. Please also note that all of our under-18 crime data are the youth crimes that have been cleared (or closed). This means that the case ended with an arrest or through exceptional means. 

# Preliminary Findings
- In the past 7 years, we have seen a decrease in youth crime. 
- Between 2017, when JRI was passed, and 2020 the total number of under-18 crimes decreased from 6404 (an average of 32.51 per agency) to 3752 (an average of 20.06) per agency. 
- We only see a slight increase in 2022, with 4928 youth crimes -still far below 6404- following a national increase in youth crime in 2021 and 2022 due to the effects of COVID-19. 
- Specifically, we see that between 2020 and 2022, the average number of youth crimes per agency increased in 47 out of 50 states and the District of Columbia. 
- When we account for population, the decrease in crime becomes even more apparent. If we look at the average number of under-18 crimes per department per 100,000 residents in the area that the law enforcement agency polices, we see that this decrease is even more staggering, dropping from an average of 138.62 under-18 crimes per department per 100,000 residents in 2017 to just 98.85 in 2022.
Youth crime makes up an insignificant proportion of all crimes. 
- Between 2017 and 2022, we can see that youth crime accounted for less than 11.00% of all crimes in Louisiana. This means that at least 9 adults are committing a crime for every youth. 
- Specifically, in 2022, youth only accounted for 8.40% of all crimes per agency on average. 
- Youth crime is decreasing in many key areas.
- The total number of under-18 murders hit a 5-year low in 2022 with 16 murders. 
- The total number of under-18 robberies decreased from 184 robberies in 2017 to 155 in 2022. This is a 19% decrease.
- The total number of under-18 assaults has decreased almost every single year since 2017, dropping from 3283 to an all-time low of 2024 in 2020.  - Assaults only increased slightly in 2021 and 2022, following a national pattern. Between 2020 and 2022, youth assaults increased rapidly in every state besides New Mexico.
- The total number of under-18 rapes decreased from 64 (an average of 0.32 per department) in 2017 to 44 (an average of 0.29 per department) in 2022. 
- The total number of under-18 burglaries decreased from 558 (an average of  2.83 per department) in 2015 to 276 (an average of 1.87 per department) in 2022. 
- Finally, the total number of under-18 thefts has decreased almost every single year from since 2017, from 1963 (an average of 9.96 per department) to 799 in 2022 (an average of 5.29 per department).
- Youth violent crime is decreasing
- Youth violent crime has decreased every single year since 2017, dropping from 857 youth violent crimes to 508 in 2021. The only increase in youth violent crime was between 2021 and 2022, where it went up to 817 - still below the total in 2017. This followed a national trend of an increase in under-18 violent crime in the vast majority of states between 2021 and 2022.
